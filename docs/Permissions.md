# Permissions

The permission system is based off the yaml files under `config/roles/`. Each file represents a role, and each role has a set of permissions. The permissions are defined in the `permissions` section of the role file. Each permission is a string that represents a permission. A role file also consists of a required id field, a required name field and an optional extends field. 

## Inheritance

Roles support inheritance through the `extends` field. The extends field can either have an integer value representing the id of a role to inherit from or an integer array of ids to inherit from. The role will inherit all permissions from the role(s) it extends from.

## Explict Wildcard

The permission system supports an explict wildcard. By adding `.*` as a permission to a role it will give the role all permissions. Note permission negation does override this. See Permission Precedence for more information.

## Implicit Wildcards

The permission system supports implicit wildcards. This means that if a role has the `order` permission it will also have the `order.create` permission along with all other permissions following the `order.*` pattern. This is useful for giving a role all permissions for a specific resource. Note permission negation does override this. See Permission Precedence for more information.

## Permission Negation

By prefacing a permission with a `~` it will negate the permission. This means that if a role has the `order` permission but not the `~order.create` permission it will not have the `order.create` permission but will have everything else under `order.*` This is useful for giving a role all permissions for a specific resource except for a few. Note that negation overrides the explict and implicit wildcards. See Permission Precedence for more information.

## Permission Precedence

The permission system handles precedence in order of specificity. E.g `account.update.self` will override `account.update` which will override `account` etc. Explicit wildcards have the lowest precedence. 

## Permission Checks

To check a permission you have two methods available to you. `user.check_permission(permission: str)` and `user.raise_without_permission(permission: str)`. The first method will return a boolean value representing if the user has the permission or not. The second method will raise a `AuthorizationError` exception if the user does not have the permission.
